## Header (*Flexbox*)
    - On mobile: Everything stacks. The logo and <h1> are centered on top, I removed h2 just to make things less clustered at the top. 
    <h2> sits right under them, and the nav comes last. Header moves away now when you scroll.
    - On tablets: The logo and <h1> sit next to each other in a row. 
    <h2> and nav are still below but more spaced out. Header moves away now when you scroll.
    - On desktop: Same flex layout, but more polished — logo + <h1> are centered, 
    <h2> sits underneath, and the nav might shift to the side or bottom depending on space.

## Main Content

### Article (*Grid*)
    - On mobile: It’s just a single column — 
    <h2> first, then paragraph and image stacked under it.
    - On tablet: The image moves to the right, 
    the text goes to the left, 
    and <h2> spans across the top.
    - On desktop: Same layout as tablet 
    but with nicer spacing and alignment.

### Section (*Grid*)
    - On mobile: Everything is stacked — <h3>, <dl>, then the image.
    - On tablet: <!-- The heading at the top center and descriptive list is on the right, 
    and the image centered on the left side. --> Changed this to have image on top and list below. looks better bc the list is very long
    - On desktop: Same as tablet, just more room to breathe.

### Section 2 with table (*Grid*)
    - On mobile: <h3> goes up top, 
    followed by the table and image one after the other.
    - On tablet: <h3> goes up top, 
    followed by the table and image one after the other.
    - On desktop: Same layout but more space between everything.

### Section 3 & 4 (*Grid*)
    - I’m combining these into one grid layout.
    - On mobile: Stacked vertically —  (already centered w/o grid)
    paragraph, <h4>, aside, then table.
    - On tablet: Form shows up on the left, 
    aside on the right. The heading and text are still centered at the top.
    - On desktop: Same layout, just spaced out nicer.

## Section 5 & Footer (*Flexbox*)
    - I’m combining these too and sticking them in the footer.
    - On mobile: The contact list and footer info stack vertically. (used grid for this)
    - On tablet: They sit side-by-side using flex 
     contact info on the left, footer on the right.
    - On desktop: Same idea, but with more space to work with.

## Changes I made and Why:
    - I changed the plan for tablet formatting. Its more of a hybrid now of the mobile layout and the desktop layout. Some sections looked better in a column like mobile, and other areas looked better in rows like the desktop format.
