# Project


## Selecting a Topic

 - I want to make a website that is a <mark>zombie apocalypse survival</mark> guide, but more of a <mark>girly fashion guide</mark> like "how to stay safe and look good doing it." Think Resident Evil or The Walking dead meets Bratz or Barbie. I think this can work like a blog website with diy survival and fashion tips and I want it to seem scary but in a cute and loveable way, inspired by the old barbie.com website and emergency preppers.
---
## Why I chose this topic
 - I really love horror and cute things so I think I wouldn't run out of ideas for a long time. My dad was really into emergency prep so I know quite a bit about it, and I've always loved girly things so I think it would be easy to mix the two in a comical format.

## Outline

### My prompt to ChatGpt
**To ChatGpt:** I'm building a website. I want to integrate my love for zombie survival and emergency preparedness, with the sass of bratz. Something like "Surviving with a passion for fashion."

### The Response
**ChatGpt:** "Something like 'Surviving with a passion for fashion.'"
"Omg, I love that direction — fierce meets fearless! "Surviving with a passion for fashion" is such a vibe. You’re blending glam with grit, and that’s super unique." 


*I like the line "fierce meets fearless" its so funny and I might just have to go with it.*

## Menu
 *I may change these later as my website develops*
### My navigation
    - Home: Main page of the website.
    - End Times Ensembles: A page centered around what to wear to stay slaying, and slaying zombies.
    - Emergency Glow-Up Kit: How to create an on-the-go kit to stay cute and alive.
    - Flirting in the Final Days: A page about meeting boys and making sure they aren't a zombie.


## Typography Enhancements
    - styling <a> links
        :hover, :focus, and :visited states
    - added smooth scrolling for when you go back to top
    - confirmed base font-size, font-family, line-height, and text-align
    - already styled h1-h4
    - set font-weight and letter-spacing
    - already set class selectors in other steps

## Decorative or Positional Enhancements
    - created border and backround for header
    - made header sticky and changed z-index so it is positioned above in z axis
    - made the link to chatGPT and fixed and on the bot left side of the index.html. 
    - I changed my layout so that the images flip with each section. I thought it would look nice and create a visual break between sections besides the headers. 
    - I ended up keeping the join us section centered because I like the way it looks in the center much better
    - I styled the dl to make them cuter on the page, and fixed the last dl on the emergency glow up kit so it was a dl like the other items instead of a header and paragraph.
    - I added hibiscus flowers to all the headers :D
    - now I'm addicted to adding flowers and putting them everywhere

## Phase 3 Overview
    - Added logo to all pages with width and height
    - header now has flexbox layout with included logo
    - implemented grid on middle sections of index.html
    - styled images and made my figcaptions smaller
    - adjusted layout plan for changes made to the flex and grid
    - contact and resources now both fit inside the footer
    - headers and footers are now consistent among all 4 main pages
    - created new page and gave it the same header and footer
    - added image and dl to new page
    - styled dl in css
    - adjusted main.topic styling in css to apply to new page alone.html
    - added backround gradient image
    - added emojis with unicode
## New Subpage (alone)
    - page has the same header, nav, and footer as the other pages.
    - the first section is styled almost exactly like index.html with slight adjustments for the height of the paragraph in grid.
    - the new page has an image that contains a proper figcaption
    - page also contains a dl
## Image Optimization
    - Added Lazy loading to all images that did not contain it. I left it off images that are visible at the start of the page, but I added it to the rest to fulfill the assignment requirements
    - My images have the height and width indicated
    - figcaptions are located beneath all my images
    - all images have alt text
## Accessibility Considerations
    - I will use proper role attributes for any necessary content so that it can be accessed by screen reader interactions or keyboard.
    - I'll avoid hiding important content like navigation and form fields
    - I'll make sure the text remains legible even when the format has changed. 
    - I'll mak4e sure the website still has a good color contrast
    - I'll make sure buttons are still easy to tap
## Standards I will follow:
    - I will follow the Bootstrap breakpoints
    - I changed my mind and decided to use the common media query breakpoints 
    ### Common Media Query breakpoints:
| Breakpoint         | Description             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| < 481px            | Mobile devices          |
| 481px — 768px      | iPads, Tablets          |
| 769px — 1024px     | Small screens, laptops  |
| 1025px — 1200px    | Desktops, large screens |
| 1201px and greater | Extra large screens, TV |

## Hero Image Design
    - I chose this image because its cute and it fits the rest of the images for the website
    - I gave the text its own backround so that its visible with the image still behind it
    - it appears on the contact.html page
    - I made the body of the page have a semi-transparent backround so the text is still legible but you can still clearly see the image behind it.
